                This is related to the screen capturing fallback, which is
                incompatible with GeForce Experience. Please deactivate GeForce
                Experience ðŸ˜‰. If this doesn't help, other apps with overlays or
                screen capturing could be the issue.

                    First, we'll add the the Big Map, this is needed so you can
                    change all the settings of the (Mini) Map; toggle markers,
                    routes, change settings. (can also be done in any browser of

                    And now the Mini Map, click on New Website. URL:

                  </List.Item>
                  <List.Item>
                    Toggle on the Big Map and sign in with your steam account

              <Accordion.Panel>
                If you activate "Show FPS", the player coordinates should be
                displayed next to the FPS. If only the FPS is visible, please
                switch to windowed mode on a small resolution. Then while on the
                small resolution switch to fullscreen. (everything should look
                super big and blurry now). Then switch to your monitor's native
                resolution. (e.g. 1920x1080). All while keeping the Show FPS
                settings in the Visuals section active.

              <Accordion.Panel>
                It would not be allowed to read the timers from the game itself.
                But it's allowed to trigger a timer by hand (you need to press
                the action hotkey). You can not be sure that the node is farmed
                in the meantime with this approach, but it's safe to use.
